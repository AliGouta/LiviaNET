## LiviaNET. 3D fully Convolutional Neural Network for semantic image segmentation

This repository contains the code of LiviaNET, a 3D fully convolutional neural network that was employed in our work: [3D fully convolutional networks for subcortical segmentation in MRI: A large-scale study](https://128.84.21.199/abs/1612.03925v1) (In current revision at NeuroImage)

Current status: Cleaning and commenting files.....

Expected date of release: 2017, April, 7th.


If you are reading this is because I did not still finish to upload all the files. Therefore, the code is incomplete!
