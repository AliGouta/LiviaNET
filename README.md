## LiviaNET. 3D fully Convolutional Neural Network for semantic image segmentation

This repository contains the code of LiviaNET, a 3D fully convolutional neural network that was employed in our work: [3D fully convolutional networks for subcortical segmentation in MRI: A large-scale study](https://128.84.21.199/abs/1612.03925v1) (In current revision at NeuroImage).

### Requirements

The code has been written in Python (2.7) and requires [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)


Current status: Cleaning and commenting files.....

Expected date of release: 2017, April, 7th.


If you are reading this is because I did not still finish to upload all the files. Therefore, the code is incomplete!

### Versions
- April,2th. 2017.


If you use this code for your research, pleae cite the original paper:

Dolz, J., C. Desrosiers, and I. Ben Ayed. "3D fully convolutional networks for subcortical segmentation in MRI: A large-scale study." arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.03925 (2016).

I strongly encourage to cite the work of Kamnitsas :"Kamnitsas, Konstantinos, et al. "Efficient multi-scale 3D CNN with fully connected CRF for accurate brain lesion segmentation." Medical Image Analysis 36 (2017): 61-78.", since this code is based on his previous work.
